Think it's a male(?) Wild Indigo rather than Juvenal's or Horace's.  The clear white spots are small, it only has the 5, &amp; it doesn't have the extra one inside the row of them (at the end of the FW cell).  The pale marginal spots are kinda indistinct (consistent with a male), but at least they're present; ditto the pale bar in the center of the HW (at the end of the cell).  And it certainly has a dark inner FW &amp; lighter brown patch beyond the FW cell.

Exactly 36 mm wingspan -- struck me when I first saw it as a very small duskywing.  But then, butterflies always seem smaller when I see them in person -- I forget how tiny they are when I'm looking at macro photos all the time!  Wild Indigo is supposed to be 35-41 mm, which puts this one towards the bottom of this relatively narrow size range.  Juvenal's is supposed to be 32-49 mm, &amp; Horace's 36-49, so in both cases that would put this one near or at the lower extreme of a much broader size range.

""Identification: Upperside is light-to-blackish brown; forewing has squarish white spots; hindwing usually has 2 rows of white spots. Underside is brown or gray with dull spots that are often obscure. Male has a costal fold enclosing scent scales on the forewing. Wing Span: 1 - 1  and 1/8 inches (2.5 - 2.9 cm). Life History: To find receptive females, males patrol and sometimes perch close to the ground in valley bottoms or swales. Females lay eggs singly on the host plant. Caterpillars make a webbed leaf nest in which they live and feed. Flight: One brood from April-July.""

Here with my former student Ryan G on a little Everglades romp. We hiked down the Gate 2A trail in Long Pine Key, after poking around HID 2020 near the big sinkholes. Then drove down to the end of Research Road and hiked a bit west before going to the Royal Palm area and walking the Anhinga boardwalk trail. Some highlights included seeing a common nighthawk on its nest (I accidentally flushed it). A faithful beauty caterpillar chowing down on Metastelma blodgettii, Florida duskywing nectaring on Guettarda scabra, some black-bellied whistling ducks (my first seen in ENP), an American bumble bee visiting Lyrthum alatum and a red-shouldered hawk posing on the Research Road powerlines. We also saw eastern towhees, pine warblers, swallow-tailed kites, northern cardinals and lots of other stuff. Good times!

I believe it. It is the only skipper I can identify without looking it up!  They are one of the largest and most widespread skippers, with dark brown wings and the distinguishing ""silver spot"" on the underside of their hindwing. 

Host plants include the Black Locust, Honey Locust, False Indigo and Lead Plant. 

Adult SSS prefer nectar from blue, red, pink and purple flowers. They rarely visit yellow flowers. This guy was enjoying the purple flowers of the Ironweed in Colburn Park. 

Females lay single, greenish, dome-shaped eggs near host plants and when larvae hatch they must find food. Like most skippers, SSS larvae live in leaf shelters. Young cats live in a shelter created by a folded flap of leaf cut from the leaf margin and tied down with silk threads.  Later instars tie together several leaves with silk threads to create a protective nest. They abandon smaller shelters as they grow and move to create new shelters. They leave these shelters at night or on cloudy days to feed. Should a predatory wasp try to take the caterpillar from it's shelter, the cat will regurgitate a greenish, defensive, bitter tasting chemical to ward them off. 

One other interesting SSS fact:  their frass is believed to have a distinctive scent that can lead parasitoid wasps to their location in the leaf shelter. To protect themselves,  the caterpillars throw their frass a long distance, as much as 30 body lengths, in order to throw predators off their trail. 

The SSS overwinters as a pupae in a dark brown chrysalis inside the last leaf nest which falls from the host plant to mix with the leaf litter. Adults emerge in the spring. 

Update:  Added one slightly clearer picture taken at New City Greenhouse on 8/22/22 in which inadvertently caught a SSS while trying to get a pic of a buckeye.
